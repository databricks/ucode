# Unity AI Gateway Coding CLI (ucode)

`ucode` is a lightweight launcher for running Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot CLI, and Pi through Databricks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+ — install with `uv` ([uv.astral.sh](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))
- `npm` if tool CLIs need to be installed automatically

## Installation

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/databricks/ucode
```

Check your version with `ucode --version`. Between releases this looks like
`0.1.0+14.g93986a8` — the trailing `g<hash>` is the exact commit the build came
from, so include it when reporting a bug.

---

## Usage

Just run the tool you want:

```bash
ucode codex      # OpenAI Codex
ucode claude     # Claude Code
ucode gemini     # Gemini CLI
ucode opencode   # OpenCode
ucode copilot    # GitHub Copilot CLI
ucode pi         # Pi
ucode cursor     # Cursor Agent (MCP only — see below)
```

On first launch, `ucode` will prompt for your Databricks workspace URL, authenticate, and configure that tool automatically. Subsequent Claude and Codex launches use the generated local settings directly. Use `ucode claude --refresh` or `ucode codex --refresh` when you want to re-check Databricks and update the model/configuration.

Pass flags directly to the underlying tool:

```bash
ucode claude -r          # resume last session
ucode codex --full-auto
```

All agents route through Databricks AI Gateway using your workspace credentials — no API keys required.

Smart routing is opt-in for Codex and Claude Code. Enabling it for a launch asks the AI Gateway
router to select models for that session and its subagents. Codex may require one-time review of
the launch-scoped hooks through `/hooks`.

```bash
ucode codex --enable-smart-routing
ucode claude --enable-smart-routing
```

The flag applies only to that launch; later launches use normal model selection unless the flag is
passed again.

To configure all tools at once:

```bash
ucode configure
```

To configure specific tools without the picker, pass a comma-separated list:

```bash
ucode configure --agents claude,codex
```

Available agent names are `codex`, `claude`, `gemini`, `opencode`, `copilot`, and `pi`. `cursor` is also accepted (MCP-only — it registers Databricks MCP servers but configures no models).

Naming agents explicitly is treated as a request for all of them: if any one isn't available on the workspace, the run fails without configuring the others. Add `--skip-unavailable` to configure the available subset instead and skip the rest with a warning:

```bash
ucode configure --agents claude,codex,pi --skip-unavailable
```

This is useful in CI against a mix of workspaces — on a workspace whose AI Gateway exposes no OpenAI models, the command above still configures `claude` and `pi`, and reports Codex as skipped. It exits non-zero only when none of the requested agents are available.

To configure without the workspace picker, pass a comma-separated list of workspaces:

```bash
ucode configure --workspaces https://first.databricks.com,https://second.databricks.com
```

When multiple workspaces are provided, `ucode` logs into and saves state for each workspace. Launch commands such as `ucode codex` use the first workspace in the list.

Alternatively, pass existing Databricks CLI profiles (from `~/.databrickscfg`) instead of workspace URLs — each profile's host supplies the workspace URL:

```bash
ucode configure --profiles DEFAULT --agents claude,codex
```

Auth behaves the same as `--workspaces`: an OAuth `databricks auth login` is forced by default.

For CI or headless environments where the profile holds a personal access token (`auth_type = pat` in `~/.databrickscfg`), add `--use-pat`. It must be combined with `--profiles` — ucode never picks up a PAT implicitly — and runs no interactive login: the profile's token is used for the whole setup (and by launched agents afterwards), with workspace access verified against the AI Gateway. `--skip-validate` additionally skips the post-configure test message sent through each agent, so configure only writes config files with the freshly discovered models. Together these make setup fully non-interactive:

```bash
ucode configure --profiles DEFAULT --agents claude,codex --use-pat --skip-validate --skip-upgrade
```

### MCP servers (optional)

```bash
ucode mcp
```

Add Databricks MCP servers to installed MCP-capable tools: Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot CLI, and Cursor Agent. MCP servers are personal, per-developer configuration — they are not part of a workspace's managed config.
Options are shown in this order:

- Discovered external MCP connections
- Databricks SQL
- Managed Databricks MCPs (Vector Search, UC Functions, etc.)
- Custom MCP server URL

Discovered external MCP connections are listed directly.

Every Databricks MCP server is registered as a local **stdio** server that runs `ucode mcp-proxy`
— a small bridge (shipped with `ucode`) between the coding tool and the Databricks
streamable-HTTP MCP endpoint. The proxy mints a fresh OAuth token from your Databricks CLI profile
on every request, so MCP auth is handled uniformly for every client and never expires mid-session.
The coding tool starts and stops the proxy as a child process; there's nothing extra to run.

**Cursor** is MCP-only: `cursor-agent` runs models on your own Cursor account, so `ucode`
configures no models for it — it only registers Databricks MCP servers in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
(via the same proxy). Include it with `ucode configure --agents cursor` or pick it in
`ucode mcp`, then launch with `ucode cursor`.

MCP configuration lives entirely under `ucode mcp` — it is separate from `ucode configure`, which
sets up workspaces and agent models. To register a specific service non-interactively, use
`ucode mcp --services system.ai.slack` (or `ucode mcp add --services …` to keep existing servers).

#### Add servers without replacing existing ones

`ucode mcp` **replaces** the registered MCP servers with your selection — anything
outside a `--location`/`--services` scope (or left unchecked in the picker) is removed. To
**add** servers while leaving everything already configured in place, use `ucode mcp add`:

```bash
# Register a whole schema's services, keeping any servers already configured.
ucode mcp add --location system.ai

# Register just a subset (same name rules as `ucode mcp --services`).
ucode mcp add --services system.ai.slack,system.ai.github

# No arguments launches the same interactive picker, but never removes servers.
ucode mcp add
```

`ucode mcp add` takes the same `--location` and `--services` options as bare `ucode mcp`;
the only difference is that it never removes servers outside the selection. In the interactive
picker, servers you already have configured are shown as `(already configured)` and can't be
toggled off — you only pick new ones to add.

Pass `--agents` to target specific coding agents. Any named agent that isn't set up yet is
configured first (workspace + models), so this doubles as one-command setup:

```bash
# Set up Claude Code (if needed) and register the server for it, in one command.
ucode mcp add --agents claude --services system.ai.slack

# Target several agents at once.
ucode mcp add --agents claude,codex --location system.ai
```

Without `--agents`, the server is registered for every already-configured agent.

#### Remove configured servers

To unregister servers you've already configured, use `ucode mcp remove`:

```bash
ucode mcp remove

# Remove only from specific agents. A server registered on several agents is
# unregistered from the named ones and kept on the rest.
ucode mcp remove --agents codex
```

It shows the servers you currently have configured — each with the coding tools it's registered
on — and removes the ones you select from those tools. It needs no Databricks login.

### Skills (optional)

Configure Unity Catalog Skills for your coding tools with `ucode skills`. Skills are personal,
per-developer configuration — they are not part of a workspace's managed config.

```bash
# Utility tools only: register the schema-less skills MCP connection, no download.
ucode skills

# Download mode: fetch every skill in the schema to disk (and register the connection).
ucode skills --location main.default --path /abs/project/dir

# Download a named subset of the schema's skills instead of all of them.
ucode skills --location main.default --skill my-skill

# MCP mode: expose the schema's skills as MCP tools instead of downloading.
ucode skills --location main.default,ml.prod --mcp
```

- **Bare command** (no `--location`) registers the schema-less skills MCP connection — the
  cross-schema utility tools only — and downloads nothing. `--mcp` with no `--location` does the
  same.
- **Download mode** (with `--location`, no `--mcp`) writes each skill flat as `<leaf>/SKILL.md`
  (plus its bundled files) into both `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/`. `--path` (an existing
  absolute directory) is optional; when omitted, skills are written under your home directory. Any
  pre-existing skill dir prompts before it's overwritten. It then registers a schema-less skills
  MCP connection, leaving any prior `--mcp` scope untouched. `--skill <name>[,<name>…]` narrows the
  download to the named skills (by leaf name) from the schema instead of all of them; requested
  names not found in the schema warn and are skipped. `--skill` requires a single `--location`, is
  download-only, and is rejected with `--mcp`.
- **MCP mode** (`--location … --mcp`) sets the connection's location set to exactly `<list>`
  (override-only) and rebuilds its `?schema=` URL; no files are downloaded and `--path` is rejected.

Each run prints the registered server, its URL, the configured agents, and its tools, and reminds
you to run `ucode <agent>` (existing agent sessions need a restart before the MCP tools load).

### Managed config for a workspace

`ucode configure` is the single entry point for both configuring your own machine and (for admins)
authoring the config your developers pick up automatically. It figures out which you need:

1. It selects and authenticates your workspace and fetches the workspace's managed config once.
2. **If the workspace already has a managed config**, `ucode configure` applies it to this machine
   automatically — showing the drift against your current settings inline, without asking you to
   approve each change. For a developer, that's it: you're configured.
3. **If you're a workspace admin**, `ucode configure` then asks whether you want to update the
   workspace's configuration. If yes (or if no managed config exists yet), it walks you through the
   agents to enable and which one bare `ucode` launches, then per agent: Databricks-hosted models or
   an external Model Provider Service and the models to expose. Claude Code is asked one model per
   family (opus/sonnet/haiku/fable), since it selects models by family alias; any family can be
   skipped.

Interactive Claude Code and Codex configuration installs gateway-critical values in the OS-managed
settings scope so enterprise settings cannot silently override ucode. Non-interactive and CI runs use
local files without invoking `sudo`, and stop with an actionable error if an existing managed value
conflicts. Claude subscription relay is local-only because its loopback proxy exists only for that
session.

Authoring only ever saves a local **draft** — nothing reaches the workspace until you run
`ucode publish`. `ucode configure` reports when your machine is configured, then (for admins) advises
publishing.

A managed config carries **agents, models, the default agent, and a tiered spend policy only**.
MCP servers and skills are personal, per-developer configuration (`ucode mcp` /
`ucode skills`) and are never part of it.

```bash
ucode configure                 # configure this machine; admins are offered authoring
ucode configure spend-tiers     # (admins) edit the tiered spend policy — the one section command
ucode publish                   # (admins) publish the draft to the workspace
```

`ucode configure spend-tiers` is the only managed-config section command. It sets a tiered spend
policy that switches everyone's default agent and model as the workspace burns through a budget, and
edits just that section of the draft. It is strictly admin-only — a non-admin gets an actionable
error and a non-zero exit.

The draft and the last-fetched published snapshot live side by side in `~/.ucode/managed-state.json`,
in separate slots: a launch refreshes the published snapshot but never touches your unpublished
draft. Admins who keep the config in version control can load a hand-written manifest as the draft
instead of running the prompts:

```bash
# (admins) Load a hand-written managed config (ucode's manifest shape) as the draft; nothing published.
ucode configure --from-file ./managed-config.json
```

Once the draft looks right, publish it:

```bash
# Validate, show a diff against what's live, and ask before publishing.
ucode publish

# Publish without the confirmation prompt (for CI).
ucode publish --yes

# Publish a config file exported with `ucode export` instead of the locally authored draft.
ucode publish -f ./managed-config.json
ucode publish --file ./managed-config.json --yes
```

`publish` updates the workspace's existing config in place rather than replacing it, so a failed
publish leaves the current config intact. It shows a diff of exactly what changes against the
published config before asking to confirm, and does nothing when the two already match. Developers
pick the new config up on their next ucode run.

If the workspace's managed-config backend isn't available, `ucode configure` still configures your
machine locally and simply doesn't offer to publish.

With `-f`/`--file`, `publish` reads a config file produced by `ucode export` and publishes it through
the same validation, diff, and confirmation flow. The file's `workspace` must match the configured
workspace (it can never redirect publication elsewhere) and its `spec_version` must be a supported
integer; server-owned fields (resource name, workspace ids, timestamps, user ids) and unknown fields
are rejected rather than silently dropped. Legacy `mcp_servers`/`skills` fields in an older exported
file are ignored rather than rejected, since the managed config no longer carries them.

### Exporting the config

`ucode export` prints the admin's local managed-config **draft** as portable JSON. The output leads
with the source `workspace` URL and a `spec_version` (the export format version), followed by the
canonical external config; credentials and server-assigned fields (the resource name, timestamps,
user ids) are excluded. It reads the draft only — never your personal settings, and never the fetched
published snapshot — so there's nothing to export until you've authored one with `ucode configure`.
Without `--file` the JSON is written to stdout; with `--file`/`-f` the same bytes are written to a
file (atomically, and the destination's parent directory must already exist) while stdout stays
empty. The exported file is exactly what `ucode publish -f <file>` consumes.

```bash
# Print the managed config as JSON.
ucode export

# Write it to a file; stdout stays empty.
ucode export --file ./managed-config.json
```

The output looks like:

```json
{
  "workspace": "https://<workspace-host>",
  "spec_version": 1,
  "default_agent": "CODING_AGENT_CLAUDE_CODE",
  "enabled_agents": [ ... ]
}
```
