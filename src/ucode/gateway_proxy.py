"""Loopback refresh proxy for relayed Anthropic (Claude Max/Team/Enterprise).

A relayed Model Provider Service authenticates the caller's own Anthropic
subscription OAuth (which Claude Code owns in the `Authorization` header) and
carries a Databricks credential in the `X-Databricks-AI-Gateway-Token` swap
header. That Databricks token is short-lived and a static settings.json header
can't be refreshed, so `ucode claude` points `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` at this proxy
instead: it forwards every request to the workspace gateway unchanged except for
adding a freshly-minted swap header, and streams the response back verbatim.

Security invariants (mirroring `databricks.py` token handling):
  - Binds 127.0.0.1 only; never exposed off-host.
  - Never logs header values or bodies. The Databricks token lives in memory,
    refreshed off the request path; the Anthropic OAuth in `Authorization` is
    passed through untouched and never read, stored, or logged.
